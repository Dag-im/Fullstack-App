**Introduction**

This is a fullstack application built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todos.

**Project Structure**

The project is divided into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

* `frontend`: This directory contains the React application code.
* `backend`: This directory contains the Node.js and Express server code.

**Frontend**

The frontend is built with React and uses the following libraries:

* `react`: The React library.
* `react-dom`: The React DOM library.
* `react-redux`: The React Redux library.
* `reduxjs/toolkit`: The Redux Toolkit library.

The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory and is organized into the following subdirectories:

* `components`: This directory contains the React components.
* `state`: This directory contains the Redux state management code.
* `styles`: This directory contains the CSS styles.

**Backend**

The backend is built with Node.js and Express and uses the following libraries:

* `express`: The Express library.
* `mongoose`: The Mongoose library.
* `cors`: The CORS library.
* `dotenv`: The Dotenv library.

The backend code is located in the `backend` directory and is organized into the following subdirectories:

* `controllers`: This directory contains the Express controllers.
* `models`: This directory contains the Mongoose models.
* `routes`: This directory contains the Express routes.
* `utils`: This directory contains utility functions.

**Database**

The application uses a MongoDB database to store the todos. The database is connected to the backend using Mongoose.

**API Endpoints**

The application has the following API endpoints:

* `GET /api/todos`: Returns a list of all todos.
* `POST /api/todos`: Creates a new todo.
* `GET /api/todos/:id`: Returns a single todo by ID.
* `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Updates a single todo by ID.
* `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Deletes a single todo by ID.

**State Management**

The application uses Redux to manage the state of the todos. The state is stored in the `state` directory and is organized into the following subdirectories:

* `actions`: This directory contains the Redux actions.
* `reducers`: This directory contains the Redux reducers.

**Components**

The application has the following components:

* `TodoList`: A list of todos.
* `TodoItem`: A single todo item.
* `TodoForm`: A form to create a new todo.

**Styles**

The application uses CSS to style the components. The styles are located in the `styles` directory.

**Testing**

The application has unit tests and integration tests. The tests are located in the `tests` directory.

**Deployment**

The application is deployed to a production environment using a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline is configured to build and deploy the application to a cloud provider.

I hope this documentation helps you understand the project better. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
